üöÄ Problem Statement
The growth of the green hydrogen sector is hindered by manual, opaque, and inefficient subsidy disbursement processes. Current systems are prone to:
‚Ä¢	Delays in subsidy release
‚Ä¢	Fraud and misuse of funds
‚Ä¢	Lack of verification of actual production or project milestones
Government bodies require a secure, automated, and transparent mechanism to ensure subsidies are disbursed only when measurable milestones‚Äîlike hydrogen production volume, project completion, or cost reduction targets‚Äîare achieved.
Additionally, the solution must integrate seamlessly with existing banking systems while maintaining immutable audit trails for compliance and transparency.

üí° Proposed Solution
We present a dual-structured subsidy disbursement platform leveraging blockchain-based smart contracts, enabling automated, secure, and transparent subsidy management.
1. Loan-based Subsidy
‚Ä¢	Companies opting for loans can receive government subsidies linked directly to loan repayments.
‚Ä¢	Banks act as trusted intermediaries to verify company authenticity and track repayment-linked disbursements.
‚Ä¢	Subsidy is released in tranches according to verified production milestones, preventing misuse and ensuring funds reach genuine, validated startups and companies.
2. Production-based Subsidy
‚Ä¢	Companies not using loans can receive subsidies based on measurable production milestones.
‚Ä¢	IoT sensors and trusted third-party data feed verified production metrics into smart contracts.
‚Ä¢	Automated triggers release subsidies proportionally to achieve milestones, incentivizing performance and technological innovation.
This approach ensures transparency, trust, and efficiency across government, banks, and companies.
